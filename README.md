# Systems_Work20 - Asking servers for a fork

## Directions:

Create a forking server system. 
  - start with the persistent server system.
  - add/modify pipe_networking.c/h so that the server side handshake is broken up appropriately.
  - modify the server program to work as a forking server
  - leave the client alone
  - you should submit pipe_networking.c/h as well as both your server and client .c files (and a makefile, as always!)
